# wolfram-automaton-cpp

A tiny, modern C++ implementation of **Wolfram’s 1D Elementary Cellular Automata** (rules 0–255).
It prints each generation to your terminal so you can watch complex patterns emerge from simple rules.

## Project Structure

```
wolfram-automaton-cpp/
├─ include/
│  └─ automaton.h          # Automaton class (declarations)
├─ src/
│  ├─ automaton.cpp        # Automaton class (definitions)
│  └─ main.cpp             # CLI entry point
├─ build/                  # Generated by CMake
├─ .gitignore              # Ignore build/ folder
├─ CMakeLists.txt          # Build configuration
└─ README.md               # You are here
```

## Build & Run

```bash
# From project root:
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./wolfram_automaton
```

You’ll be prompted for a **rule number (0–255)**:

```
Enter rule: 30
```

And the automaton evolves over time directly in your terminal.

## Wolfram Rules Explained

Each rule is defined by an **8-bit binary number** describing what happens to a cell given its left, current, and right neighbors.

For example, **Rule 30** corresponds to:

```
111 → 0
110 → 0
101 → 0
100 → 1
011 → 1
010 → 1
001 → 1
000 → 0
```

Binary: `00011110₂` → Decimal: `30`.

Some famous rules:

* **Rule 30** → chaotic, pseudorandom behavior
* **Rule 90** → Sierpiński triangle
* **Rule 110** → complex, Turing complete!

## Examples to Try

| Rule | Behavior                           |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- |
| 0    | All cells die immediately          |
| 30   | Chaotic, seemingly random patterns |
| 90   | Sierpiński triangle                |
| 110  | Complex, computationally universal |
| 250  | Simple repetitive propagation      |

> “The simplest class of one-dimensional cellular automata. Each cell has two possible states (0 or 1), and rules that depend only on nearest neighbors. There are exactly 2⁸ = 256 such rules.”
